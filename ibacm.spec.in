%description
The %{name} daemon helps reduce the load of managing path record lookups on
large InfiniBand fabrics by providing a user space implementation of what
is functionally similar to an ARP cache.  The use of %{name}, when properly
configured, can reduce the SA packet load of a large IB cluster from O(n^2)
to O(n).  The %{name} daemon is started and normally runs in the background,
user applications need not know about this daemon as long as their app
uses librdmacm to handle connection bring up/tear down.  The librdmacm
library knows how to talk directly to the %{name} daemon to retrieve data.

Summary: Headers file needed when building apps to talk directly to ibacm.
Requires: %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
Group: System Environment/Daemons

%description devel
Most applications do not need to know how to talk directly to the ibacm
daemon, but it does have a socket that it listens on, and it has a
specific protocol for incoming/outgoing data.  So if you wish to build
the ability to communicate directly with %{name} into your own application,
the protocol used to communicate with it, and the data structures
involved, are in this header file.  Please note that this is an unsupported
method of using this daemon.  The only supported means of using this is
via librdmacm.  As such, even though this header file is provided, no
further documentation is available.  One must read the source if they
wish to make use of this header file.
